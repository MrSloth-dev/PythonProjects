# PythonProjects

With help of LLM I got a list of projects that I will try to develop.
Hope to reach the end with sufficient knowledge to make anything :)


## Beginner (Core Python & Finance Basics)
0. Currency Converter CLI – Fetch real-time exchange rates
1. Transaction Simulator – Generate fake transactions (CSV/SQLite).
2. Basic Fraud Flagging – Rule-based (e.g., flag large withdrawals).
3. REST API for User Balances – FastAPI/Flask + SQLite.
4. Monthly Spending Analyzer – Pandas + Matplotlib.
 ## Intermediate (Banking Systems & Data Pipelines)
5. Payment Processing Webhook – Mock third-party integrations (Stripe-like).
6. Account Activity Dashboard – Flask + PostgreSQL + Plotly.
7. Batch Fraud Detection – Scikit-learn (logistic regression on transaction data).
8. Async Transaction Logger – FastAPI + Redis (real-time logging).
9. Reconciliation Tool – Compare two transaction datasets (Pandas).
 ## Advanced-Intermediate (High-Scale Systems)
10. Card Transaction Limiter – Rate-limiting API (Redis + FastAPI).
11. Microservice for Notifications – Kafka/PubSub + Python (emails/SMS).
12. Risk Scoring Engine – Rule-based + ML (flag high-risk users).
13. Multi-Currency Wallet API – Django/Flask + Forex API.
14. Real-Time Analytics – Websockets + TimescaleDB (live dashboards).
 ## Advanced (Production-Grade Systems)
15. Fraud Detection Microservice – XGBoost/FastAPI + PostgreSQL (online inference).
16. Distributed Transaction Ledger – Python + Kafka (event sourcing).
17. Auto-Budgeting Engine – Recurring transactions + ML clustering.
18. High-Frequency Trading Simulator – AsyncIO + Binance API.
19. Scalable ETL for Financial Data – PySpark + Airflow (batch/streaming).
